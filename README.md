# Raspberry_Pi-House_Alarm_System
The Alarm System is made using Raspberry Pi 3. It has two states "active" and "inactive". It detects nearby objects by a Ultransonic sensor and makes sound from a buzzer when it is in its "active" state, which is enabled by a passcode entered through a keypad by the user in "inactive" state. Rentering the same password in the "active" state causes the system to deactivate and go into "inactive" state.
